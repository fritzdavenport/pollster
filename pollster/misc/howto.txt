##To connect to your zoo account:
http://www.uvm.edu/~hag/webpub/?Page=wpcheck.html&SM=wpbeginmenu.html

#in linux:
open a terminal, type ssh zoo.uvm.edu	 -l NETID, substituting your uvm netID. If you are running a recent version of Ubuntu or another distribution that uses the Gnome program 'Files' you can click the menu and type in "Connect to Server". Type "ftp://zoo.uvm.edu", you will be prompted for your netid and password. 

##DB access  !!! NOT NEEDED WITH SQLITE
https://webdb.uvm.edu/phpMyAdmin
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS USERNAME_nfs

Send the credentials file to a uvm it guy ->

<?php
  $db_name = 'username_dbname';
  $dbu = 'username_admin';
  $dbp = 'password';
?>

they will tell you the file path of the 'locked down' file, 
you will include it like this:

require('/usr/local/uvm-inc/username.inc'); most likely substituting 'username.inc' for your username.
